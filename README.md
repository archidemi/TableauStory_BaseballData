### Summary

### Design

### Feedback
Questions are gathered from the first sketch.

#### Plot 1
1. What does the "avg" take average on? What does "HR" mean? Count?
1. Are there easier way to present there are no overlap?
1. Runner sounds different from home runner.

#### Plot 2
1. What's the "Avg.Avg."?
1. No idea how to read the box plot.

#### Plot 3
1. This is a good one!

#### Plot 4
1. What does the color mean?

#### Plot 5
1. The plot names "h-bat-hist", "w-bat-hist" seem mysterious...

#### Plot 6
1. Only coloring or sizing may be more straightforward instead of the two indicating the same thing.

#### Plot 7
1. The same thing as in Plot 5.

#### Plot 8
1. Lots of presentation but lack of information.
